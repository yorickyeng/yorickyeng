- Joke app [al_jokes](https://github.com/yorickyeng/al_jokes). Developed as part of a collaborative educational project with T-Bank. The app works with an API that loads jokes and databases where they are stored and displayed on the screen.

- Music app [Chillify](https://github.com/yorickyeng/Chillify). A collaborative project I'm working on with a friend. The idea is to pull music via API and play it.
